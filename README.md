# RPi_3_b-and-slb9670_TPM-secure-boot
Secure Boot a Raspberry Pi 3 B, with u-boot and slb9670 infenion TPM2

We need a Raspberry Pi 3 B with raspbian OS, a TPM2 slb9670 Infenion and U-boot as second bootloader.
U-boot on a RPi 3 B, cannot communicate with TPM slb9670, during boot. 
So new code added to u-boot/arch/arm/dts/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dts.
Also code added to u-boot/cmd/tpm-v2.c, so that u-boot could read non volatile memmory of slb9670 during boot.

Lets assume we have a working Raspberry Pi 3 B with Raspbian OS and a Infenion TPM slb9670 connected to SPI port.
First we have to add to conig.txt three commands

dtparam=spi=on

kernel=u-boot.bin

dtoverlay=tpm-slb9670


Then we must install the TPM framework, so that the OS can communicate with TPM.

first we make an update and then install the dependecies

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get upgrade 

sudo apt-get â€“y install \

autoconf-archive \ 

libcmocka0 \ 

libcmocka-dev \ 

procps \ 

iproute2 \ 

build-essential \ 

git \ 

pkg-config \ 

gcc \ 

libtool \ 

automake \ 

libssl-dev \ 

uthash-dev \ 

autoconf \ 

doxygen \ 

libjson-c-dev \ 

libini-config-dev \ 

libcurl4-openssl-dev \

U-boot sudo apt-get \

uuid-dev \ 

pandoc \ 

bison \ 

flex \ 

libncurses-dev


for the TPM framework


git clone https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss ~/tpm2-tss

cd ~/tpm2-tss 

sudo ./bootstrap 

sudo ./configure 

sudo make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install 

sudo ldconfig


git clone https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss-engine ~/tpm2-tss-engine

cd ~/tpm2-tss-engine 

sudo ./bootstrap 

sudo ./configure 

sudo make -j$(nproc) 

sudo make install 

sudo ldconfig


git clone https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools ~/tpm2-tools 

cd ~/tpm2-tools 

sudo ./bootstrap 

sudo ./configure 

sudo make -j$(nproc) 

sudo make install 

sudo ldconfig




We compile the device tree for tpm the "tpm-slb9670.dts"

dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o tpm-slb9670.dtbo tpm-slb9670.dts

and finaly add the compiled file "tpm-slb9670.dtbo" to boot/dtoverlay dir


We Reboot the RPi and check if TPM is working

sudo tpm2 get_random   it should return a random number from TPM

sudo tpm2 pcr_read   it should return the content of PCRs of TPM


Install the u-boot

git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot ~/u-boot 

cd ~/u-boot

replace the ~/u-boot/arch/arm/dts/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dts, with the one provided in this repository

replace the ~/u-boot/cmd/tpm-v2.c, with the one provided in this repository


We are ready to compile u-boot

sudo make distclean 

sudo make rpi_3_32b_defconfig 

sudo make menuconfig


Choose 


Boot options 

  [*] Enable preboot 

  (pci enum; usb start; setenv bootdelay 5) preboot default value 


Library routines -> Security support 

  [*] Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Support


Device Drivers -> [*] SPI Support 

  [*] Enable Driver Model for SPI drivers 

  [*] Soft SPI driver


Device Drivers -> TPM support 

  [*] TPMv2.x support 

  [*] Enable support for TPMv2.x SPI chips 


Command line interface -> Security commands 

  [*] Support 'hash' command 

  [*] Enable the 'tpm' command 



Misc commands 

  [*] gettime command

  [*] timer command



and finaly 

sudo make all

the file u-boot.bin is ceated and we have to copy it to boot dir

sudo cp u-boot.bin /boot

We reboot RPi and break the booting sequence of u-boot and try some TPM commands to verify communication between u-boot and TPM.

try tpm2 init and then  tpm2 info, it should return info about TPM.
