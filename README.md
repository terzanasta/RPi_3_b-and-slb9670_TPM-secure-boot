# RPi_3_b-and-slb9670_TPM-secure-boot
Secure Boot generally means to boot the OS only if kernel files are not modified by external reasons such as virus, bad actor etcâ€¦

With a script we calculate the hash of kernel7.img and bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb and stores it to non volatile memory of TPM (PCR 23)

During boot the u-boot calculates the hash of kernel7.img and bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb and compares it with the one stored in NV memory of TPM. If they are the same then booting process is continued if not halt the booting proccess.
