# RPi_3_b with slb9670 TPM, secure boot

Secure Boot generally means to boot the OS only if kernel files are not modified by external reasons such as virus, bad actor etcâ€¦

With a script we calculate the hash of kernel7.img and bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb and stores it to non volatile memory of TPM.

During boot the u-boot calculates the hash of kernel7.img and bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb and compares it with the one stored in NV memory of TPM. If they are the same then booting process is continued if not the booting proccess is halted.
